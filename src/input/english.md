podcasts, sometimes there are live talk shows.  All music in the playlist is
freely distributed (Creative Commons or otherwise), the playlist is [available
at Last.fm][lfm].  Listeners can vote for music they like and against music they
don't using [a special program][app] or a [jabber][jab] client.

The radio is fully automated and mostly operated by robots.  They discover new
music, build playlists, announce upcoming concerts (listed on Last.fm), play
voice mail sent by the listeners, archive and publish live shows as a podcasts,
[twit][twi] and do other useful stuff.  Only free software is used to run this
radio, including [some that we wrote ourselves][oss], which means you can set up
a similar system if you like.

We have a GSM hotline (+79117003831) which you can dial and leave a voice
message which would be played online immediately and then 10 times with 30
minute intervals.
