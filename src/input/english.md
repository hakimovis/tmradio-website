title: About tmradio.net
---
TMRadio is a non-commercial open internet radio.  It streams music news and
podcasts, sometimes there are live talk shows.  All music in the playlist is
freely distributed (Creative Commons or otherwise), the playlist is [available
at Last.fm][lfm].  Listeners can vote for music they like and against music they
don't using a special program (see below).

The radio is fully automated and mostly operated by robots.  They discover new
music, build playlists, announce upcoming concerts (discovered on Last.fm), play
voice mail sent by the listeners, archive and publish live shows as a podcasts,
[twit][twi] and do other useful stuff.  Only free software is used to run this
radio, including [some that we wrote ourselves][oss], which means you can set up
a system like that for yourself.

We are open for all kinds of collaboration.  Send your free music or ideas to
[info@tmradio.net][eml].


## <a href="/english.html#voting" name="voting">Voting for music</a>

The simplest way is to use [our home made program][prg], which lets you listen
to the radio, stay in the chat room and vote for track.  This is what it looks
like:

We're working on porting this program to Windows and OS X; until then you can
vote by sending "rocks" or "sucks" to our jabber bot, robot@tmradio.net.  The
chat room is [tmradio@conference.jabber.ru][con].
